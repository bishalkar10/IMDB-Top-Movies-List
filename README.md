This is a Web scrapping project using python 'request' and 'BeautifulSoup' module. I have scrapped the data from the IMDB website.   
To use the proejct on your computer you need to install 3 modules.  
1. request 
2. BeautifulSoup4 
3. pandas 
Remember that you need to have Python version 3.6 and above installed on your computer. As this project has been built using Python version 3.11 . You need Pip to install the modules.    
There is a .csv file inside the repo. You can uncomment the the last line in the python source code and change the "table.csv" file to something else or you can even specify the file path too
